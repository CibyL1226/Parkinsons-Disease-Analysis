# Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Early Detection and Progression Analysis with Machine Learning

Our team utilized data from PPMI (Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative) with machine learning to find ways to improve early detection of Parkinson's Disease. The goal is to determine the key features in Parkinson's Disease Development.

## Introduction
Parkinson's disease is estimated to affect over 14.2 million people by 2040 due to increasing longevity and declining birth rate. The disease progresses slowly, but early detection is critical in mitigatign its symptoms and improving the quality of life. 

## Data Source
We got our training data from [PPMI website](http://ppmi-info.org), which includes measurements from questionnaires. 

## Process
1. Data cleaning and transformation
2. Data exploration: PCA, K-Means Clustering
3. Feature Engineering: Importance Score
4. Unsupervised Learning: SGDC(Stochastic Gradient Descendent Classifier), Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
5. Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks
